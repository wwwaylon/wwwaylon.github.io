# Ensuring Equity in Research: The Role of Biostatisticians in Promoting Diverse and Inclusive Study Designs

Achieving equity in research requires careful planning, especially in how studies are designed. Biostatisticians play a crucial role in making sure that research isn’t just focused on one group of people (i.e., the idea that the mean goes up or down) but acknowledges contextual effects. Their expertise helps ensure that studies are conducted in a way that truly represents the diversity of the population, making the results more meaningful and impactful.

Historically, this level of inclusivity hasn’t always been the norm in research. One major barrier has been concerns about statistical power. Including underrepresented groups often requires oversampling smaller populations, which can be resource-intensive. Many studies have been designed to optimize efficiency and minimize costs, which can lead to a focus on larger, more homogeneous samples that boost statistical power but fail to capture the diverse experiences of different demographic groups. In some cases, researchers may have avoided including diverse groups out of concern that it would complicate analysis or make it harder to detect significant effects.

For example, consider a study on cardiovascular disease. Without careful planning, the research could easily overrepresent middle-aged men, traditionally considered the “standard” demographic, while neglecting women of color, whose risk factors and outcomes may differ significantly. Including these groups might require a larger sample size to maintain statistical power, and some researchers have historically shied away from that due to perceived resource constraints. Yet this exclusion results in findings that don’t generalize well to the entire population, missing critical insights into how the disease affects different groups.

Biostatisticians play a pivotal role in overcoming these challenges. They can work with researchers to design studies that intentionally include underrepresented populations without sacrificing statistical power. By using stratified sampling or carefully adjusting models to account for smaller sample sizes, biostatisticians ensure that the research is both inclusive and robust. This type of intentional design leads to findings that are not only scientifically sound but also relevant to a wide range of populations, driving more equitable and impactful health outcomes.

## Why Diversity and Inclusion Matter in Research

The lack of diversity in research has far-reaching consequences. Studies that exclude underrepresented populations often lead to findings that do not generalize across diverse groups, potentially exacerbating health disparities. This oversight can also lead to missed opportunities for discovering critical factors that influence health outcomes in marginalized communities. Research that embraces diversity not only fosters more equitable outcomes but also enhances the overall quality and robustness of the findings.

## The Biostatistician’s Role in Promoting Diversity

Biostatisticians, with their expertise in study design and data analysis, are uniquely positioned to drive efforts toward inclusive and diverse research. From planning through execution, there are several key areas where biostatisticians can make a significant impact:

### 1. Incorporating Diversity in Sampling Strategies

Participant selection presents a crucial opportunity to enhance both the scientific rigor and inclusivity of a study. With biostatisticians guiding the process, sampling strategies can be designed not only for statistical validity but also with the specific goal of including underrepresented groups. By applying stratified sampling techniques, the study can capture the full diversity of the population, reducing bias and ensuring that a broad range of experiences is reflected. Careful consideration of factors like race, ethnicity, gender, socioeconomic status, and geography leads to a more representative sample. This approach ensures that the research findings are both scientifically sound and relevant to diverse populations, driving more equitable and meaningful outcomes.

### 2. Designing Studies that Address Health Disparities

Biostatisticians can lead efforts to design studies that specifically aim to address health disparities. This involves identifying key variables that may differ across population groups, such as access to healthcare, environmental exposures, or cultural practices. By modeling the interaction between these variables and health outcomes, researchers can uncover the structural and social determinants of health that contribute to disparities. These insights can guide interventions that are tailored to the needs of specific communities.

### 3. Ensuring Adequate Power to Detect Differences Across Groups

An inclusive study design must also ensure that it is sufficiently powered to detect meaningful differences across subgroups. Biostatisticians can work closely with researchers to conduct power analyses that take into account the unique needs of diverse populations. This includes planning for oversampling of smaller or marginalized groups, which may require additional resources but is critical for achieving valid and reliable results. Without adequate power, important differences between groups may go undetected, perpetuating inequities.

### 4. Addressing Missing Data and Bias

Inclusive research also requires careful attention to missing data and bias, which disproportionately affect underrepresented populations. Biostatisticians can implement advanced imputation techniques, such as multiple imputation, to handle missing data in a way that preserves the integrity of the sample. Additionally, sensitivity analyses can be used to assess how different assumptions about missing data may influence the study’s conclusions. By addressing these methodological challenges head-on, biostatisticians ensure that diverse populations are accurately represented in the analysis.

### 5. Collaborating with Multidisciplinary Teams

Promoting diversity and inclusion in research is a team effort. Biostatisticians can lead by example by fostering collaboration with diverse researchers, including community stakeholders, clinicians, and qualitative methodologists. This interdisciplinary approach ensures that diverse perspectives are considered at every stage of the research process, from framing the research question to disseminating findings. Engaging with communities that are often excluded from research ensures that the study design reflects their lived experiences and priorities.

## Ethical and Inclusive Research: A Commitment to Equity

Biostatisticians’ responsibility extends beyond methodological rigor—it involves a commitment to ethical research practices that promote equity. In addition to designing studies that are inclusive and representative, biostatisticians must also ensure that the findings are disseminated in ways that are accessible to the communities they aim to serve. This includes advocating for open science practices, transparency in reporting, and public engagement with research findings.

Biostatisticians can also use their positions to advocate for systemic change within the research community, encouraging funding agencies and review boards to prioritize diversity and inclusion in grant-making and study approval processes. By leading with a commitment to equity, biostatisticians can help shift the culture of research toward one that truly values and reflects the experiences of all populations.

## Conclusion

As biostatisticians, we are uniquely positioned to shape research that not only advances scientific knowledge but also promotes health equity. By embracing diversity and inclusion in our study designs, we can help bridge the gap between research and real-world impact. This is not just a methodological challenge, but an ethical obligation that reflects our commitment to creating a more just and equitable society.

Let us continue to lead by example, designing studies that are representative, inclusive, and impactful, so that research becomes a powerful tool for advancing health equity for all.
