It was a Tuesday afternoon when a PI I'd been working with for almost a year sent a message that stopped me mid-thought. Not a question. Not a request. Just a single line: *"I think we need to rethink the direction of this project."*

No context. No meeting invite. Just that.

I spent the rest of the afternoon cycling through interpretations — had I done something wrong? Was the collaboration ending? Was this about the last conversation we had, where I'd raised some concerns I wasn't sure landed well? By the time I finally replied, I had drafted and deleted four different responses, each one a little more guarded than the last.

When we finally talked, it turned out the NIH program officer had raised a new priority area during a recent call, and the PI was trying to figure out how to pivot before the next progress report. It had nothing to do with me. But I had been ready to treat it like it did.

That afternoon taught me something I've come back to many times since.

> Most of the tension we feel in collaborative research isn't about us. It's about everything happening around us that we can't yet see.

## **The Instinct to Interpret — and Why It Misleads Us**

We are pattern-recognition machines. When something feels off in a working relationship, we reach for explanations quickly — and we tend to reach for the ones that center ourselves. *They're frustrated with me. They don't trust my judgment. They think someone else could do this better.*

Sometimes those explanations are worth examining. But more often, they aren't accurate — and acting on them quietly shapes how we show up. We become a little more careful, a little more distant, a little more focused on being right than on being useful.

I've watched junior colleagues go quiet in meetings because they convinced themselves a PI didn't value their input, when really the PI was preoccupied with a grant renewal they hadn't mentioned to anyone. I've seen people start cc'ing supervisors on emails as a subtle form of self-protection, when a direct conversation would have resolved things in ten minutes.

The instinct to protect ourselves is natural. But it can crowd out the more useful instinct, which is to stay curious.

*"Before you decide what a situation means, give it a little more time and one more conversation."*

## **Know Your Leverage — and Sit With It a While**

There's something worth saying plainly to junior biostatisticians: you have real influence in research collaborations. The work doesn't move forward without you, and PIs generally know that. That influence can feel empowering when things are going well and quietly tempting when they aren't.

Leverage — the ability to escalate, to push back formally, to make a difficult collaboration more difficult — exists. And there are moments when using it is the right and necessary thing to do. But I'd encourage you to sit with it for a while before reaching for it, especially early in your career.

Here's a conversation I've seen play out more than once, in different forms:

A biostatistician feels like a PI isn't respecting the time required for careful work. Deadlines keep shifting. Requests come in at the last minute. After months of this, they mention — maybe to a supervisor, maybe in a meeting — that the timeline expectations aren't realistic. The PI hears about it secondhand. The relationship, which had been functional if imperfect, becomes guarded on both sides.

Now imagine a different version of that same situation. The biostatistician asks for thirty minutes: *"I want to make sure I'm supporting you as well as I can — can we talk through how the timeline is working from your end?"* The PI shares that a co-investigator dropped off the project two months ago and they've been quietly absorbing the work ever since. The conversation doesn't solve everything, but it changes what the problem actually is. And it keeps the door open.

Leverage used too early forecloses conversations that haven't happened yet. And some of those conversations would have changed everything.

## **Looking for What's Actually There**

Hard situations have textures. When we slow down enough to look, we usually find something more complicated — and more workable — than the story we started with.

### When Personalities Clash

Some PIs are blunt in ways that sting. Others are so deferential that you never quite know where you stand. Some go silent under stress; others flood your inbox. Early in a collaboration, these differences can feel like friction. Over time, they tend to reveal themselves as information.

I worked with a PI for almost two years before I understood that her terseness in writing was completely disconnected from her regard for the people she worked with. She was simply a person who treated email like a telegram. Once I stopped reading tone into her messages, I stopped bracing for conversations that were never going to be as hard as I'd imagined.

Not every personality difference resolves that neatly. But most of them become easier once you stop expecting the other person to communicate the way you do.

### When Workload Is the Real Story

A PI who seems disengaged, slow to respond, or inconsistent in their priorities is usually not indifferent — they are overwhelmed. Faculty life carries a weight that is largely invisible to collaborators: grant cycles, teaching loads, committee obligations, mentoring, clinical responsibilities, departmental politics. The bandwidth left over for careful, unhurried collaboration is often genuinely thin.

When I started to understand this, I stopped taking slow responses personally and started asking myself: *What can I do to make this easier for them to engage with?* Sometimes that meant shortening an email to three sentences. Sometimes it meant offering a recommendation instead of a list of options. Small adjustments, but they changed the rhythm of a lot of collaborations.

### When Funding Shapes Everything

Research doesn't happen in a vacuum. It happens inside grant structures, contract timelines, funder expectations, and institutional priorities — and most of those constraints are not visible to everyone on the team.

I remember a conversation with a PI who kept redirecting a project in ways that felt inconsistent with what we'd discussed at the outset. I was confused, and honestly a little frustrated. When I finally asked — not to challenge, just to understand — she walked me through a conversation with the program officer that had reframed what the funder wanted to see at the next milestone. None of my confusion had been unreasonable. But neither had her decisions. I just hadn't known what she was navigating.

Asking about constraints is not a sign of weakness. It's how you become a collaborator instead of just a service provider.

### When the Data or the Model Is the Hard Part

Sometimes the difficulty in a collaboration has nothing to do with people at all. The data doesn't behave the way anyone planned. The model surfaces something inconvenient. A key assumption doesn't hold. These moments are genuinely stressful, and that stress tends to find a target — sometimes it lands on you.

What I've learned in those situations is that the most useful thing I can offer is not defensiveness and not detachment, but steadiness. A PI who is worried about what the results mean for their study doesn't need me to explain why it isn't my fault. They need someone who can think clearly alongside them about what to do next.

<div class="callout">
*"When the data disappoints, your steadiness becomes a form of leadership — even if you're the most junior person in the room."*
</div>

## **Some Things Worth Practicing**

These aren't rules. They're small habits I've found useful when situations get hard.

- **Ask one more question before drawing a conclusion.** "What's driving the timeline on this?" or "Is there context I'm missing?" often opens up the conversation entirely.
- **Name the constraint, not the person.** *"I want to make sure we're protecting the integrity of this finding — can we talk through the tradeoffs?"* lands differently than *"That approach isn't going to work."*
- **Offer a path, not just a problem.** When you raise a concern, come with at least one idea for how to move forward. It signals that you're invested in the outcome, not just the complaint.
- **Find perspective, not an audience.** When you're struggling, talk to a trusted senior colleague — not to vent, but to think. There's a difference, and it matters for how you show up afterward.
- **Document decisions, not grievances.** Keep clear notes on what was decided and why. It protects the science and keeps the focus where it belongs.

## **On Knowing When to Escalate**

None of this is an argument for absorbing dysfunction indefinitely. There are situations that require escalation — when scientific integrity is genuinely at risk, when ethical concerns arise, when a working relationship becomes harmful despite real effort to repair it.

But escalation done well comes from clarity, not exhaustion. Before you escalate, it's worth asking yourself: Have I said, directly and clearly, what the problem is? Have I given the relationship a real chance to work through it? Can I describe the concern specifically, without it becoming about the person?

If you can answer yes, then advocating firmly — and through the right channels — is not a failure of collaboration. It's part of taking the work seriously.

> The colleagues I've learned the most from were not the ones who were never frustrated. They were the ones who stayed curious long enough to find out what was actually going on.

**A closing thought:** The difficult moments in this work are not detours from your development as a biostatistician. They are part of it. The judgment to know when to push and when to listen, when to advocate and when to understand — that judgment builds slowly, through experience and reflection. Go into hard situations assuming good faith, paying attention to what you don't yet know, and remembering that the person across the table is usually doing the best they can with what they have. So are you.
