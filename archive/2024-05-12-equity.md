Collaboration in research is rarely as clean as the org charts and grant rosters suggest. As biostatisticians, we sit at an unusual intersection — technically indispensable, yet often operating at the edges of decisions that shape our own work. When things get difficult, and they will, the way we navigate those moments matters as much as the quality of our methods.

> Most of the tension we feel in collaborative research isn't about us. It's about everything happening around us that we can't yet see.

## **The Instinct to Interpret — and Why It Misleads Us**

When something feels off in a working relationship, we reach for explanations quickly — and we tend to reach for the ones that center ourselves. *They're frustrated with me. They don't trust my judgment. They think someone else could do this better.*

Sometimes those explanations are worth examining. But more often, they aren't accurate — and acting on them quietly shapes how we show up. We become a little more careful, a little more distant, a little more focused on being right than on being useful.

We sometimes go quiet in meetings because we've convinced ourselves a PI doesn't value our input, when really they're preoccupied with a grant renewal they haven't mentioned to anyone. Or we start cc'ing supervisors on emails as a subtle form of self-protection, when a direct conversation would have resolved things in ten minutes.

The instinct to protect ourselves is natural. But it can crowd out the more useful instinct, which is to stay curious about what's actually going on.

<div class="callout-secondary">
*"Before you decide what a situation means, give it a little more time and one more conversation."*
</div>

## **Know Your Leverage — and Sit With It a While**

We have real influence in research collaborations. The work doesn't move forward without us, and PIs generally know that. That influence can feel empowering when things are going well and quietly tempting when they aren't.

Leverage — the ability to escalate, to push back formally, to make a difficult collaboration more difficult — exists. And there are moments when using it is the right and necessary thing to do. But it's worth sitting with it for a while before reaching for it.

Consider a situation where we feel a PI isn't respecting the time required for careful work — deadlines keep shifting, requests come in at the last minute. After months of this, the concern gets surfaced sideways, mentioned to a supervisor or in a meeting before ever being raised directly. The PI hears about it secondhand. The relationship, which had been functional if imperfect, becomes guarded on both sides.

Now consider a different version. We ask for thirty minutes: *"I want to make sure I'm supporting you as well as I can — can we talk through how the timeline is working from your end?"* The PI shares that a co-investigator dropped off the project and they've been quietly absorbing the work ever since. The conversation doesn't solve everything, but it changes what the problem actually is. And it keeps the door open.

Leverage used too early forecloses conversations that haven't happened yet. And some of those conversations would have changed everything.

## **Looking for What's Actually There**

Hard situations have textures. When we slow down enough to look, we usually find something more complicated — and more workable — than the story we started with.

### When Personalities Clash

Some PIs are blunt in ways that sting. Others are so deferential that you never quite know where you stand. Some go silent under stress; others flood your inbox. Early in a collaboration, these differences can feel like friction. Over time, they tend to reveal themselves as information about how someone operates — not about how they feel about us.

Terseness in writing is not always coldness. Brevity in feedback is not always dismissal. Most communication styles that initially read as difficult become more navigable once we stop expecting the other person to communicate the way we do, and start paying attention to what they're actually trying to convey.

### When Workload Is the Real Story

A PI who seems disengaged, slow to respond, or inconsistent in their priorities is usually not indifferent — they are overwhelmed. Faculty life carries a weight that is largely invisible to collaborators: grant cycles, teaching loads, committee obligations, mentoring, clinical responsibilities, departmental politics. The bandwidth left over for careful, unhurried collaboration is often genuinely thin.

When that's the context, the more useful question becomes: *What can we do to make this easier for them to engage with?* Sometimes that means shortening an email to three sentences. Sometimes it means offering a concrete recommendation instead of a list of options. Small adjustments, but they can change the rhythm of a collaboration meaningfully.

### When Funding Shapes Everything

Research happens inside grant structures, contract timelines, funder expectations, and institutional priorities — and most of those constraints are not visible to everyone on the team. When a PI makes decisions that seem inconsistent or hard to follow, there is often a funding conversation in the background that hasn't been shared.

Asking about those constraints — not to challenge, but to understand — is one of the most useful things we can do. *Is there context I'm missing about where this project needs to go?* That question, asked genuinely, often surfaces the real situation. And once we understand the real situation, we can actually help.

### When the Budget Runs Out and We're the One Who Has to Move

A PI reaches out and asks to meet. The tone is a little more formal than usual. And then they tell us: there isn't enough funding left in the grant to keep us on at our current effort level. They need to move us off, at least for now.

The first instinct is often to feel betrayed — *I've been here from the beginning. I know this data. I helped shape this work.* And underneath that, something harder: *How did this happen? Didn't they see this coming?*

The truth is, sometimes they didn't manage the budget well. Grant finances are complicated, and PIs vary enormously in how closely they track their remaining funds. Budget mismanagement is real and more common than the research world tends to acknowledge openly. But the PI delivering this news is almost certainly not doing it to diminish us. They are often embarrassed, often scrambling to find a solution, and often genuinely hoping the situation is temporary.

That doesn't mean we don't have questions worth asking. We do. *Is there a path back onto the grant? Are there other projects where my effort could be supported? Can we document the work completed so it isn't lost?* These are fair, professional questions, and a thoughtful PI will engage with them seriously.

What tends to be less productive — even when completely understandable — is letting the frustration of the moment close down the conversation. The PI sitting across from us may well be the person best positioned to help us land somewhere stable. Keep that door open if you can.

<div class="callout-secondary">
*"The person delivering difficult news is not always the person who caused the difficulty. Sometimes they're the one trying to manage the fallout."*
</div>

### When the Data or the Model Is the Hard Part

Sometimes the difficulty in a collaboration has nothing to do with people at all. The data doesn't behave the way anyone planned. The model surfaces something inconvenient. A key assumption doesn't hold. These moments are genuinely stressful, and that stress tends to find a target.

The most useful response in these situations is not defensiveness and not detachment — it's steadiness. A PI who is worried about what the results mean for their study doesn't need an explanation of why it isn't our fault. They need a collaborator who can think clearly alongside them about what to do next.

<div class="callout">
*"When the data disappoints, our steadiness becomes a form of leadership — even if we're the most junior person in the room."*
</div>

## **Some Things Worth Practicing**

These aren't rules. They're habits of mind that tend to be useful when situations get hard.

- **Ask one more question before drawing a conclusion.** *"What's driving the timeline on this?"* or *"Is there context I'm missing?"* often opens up the conversation entirely.
- **Name the constraint, not the person.** *"I want to make sure we're protecting the integrity of this finding — can we talk through the tradeoffs?"* lands differently than *"That approach isn't going to work."*
- **Offer a path, not just a problem.** When we raise a concern, coming with at least one idea for how to move forward signals investment in the outcome, not just the complaint.
- **Find perspective, not an audience.** When we're struggling, talking to a trusted senior colleague — not to vent, but to think — makes a meaningful difference in how we show up afterward.
- **Document decisions, not grievances.** Keep clear notes on what was decided and why. It protects the science and keeps the focus where it belongs.

## **On Knowing When to Escalate — and Who Actually Matters**

There are situations that require escalation — when scientific integrity is genuinely at risk, when ethical concerns arise, when a working relationship becomes harmful despite real effort to repair it. Recognizing those situations and acting on them clearly is part of professional integrity.

But escalation done well comes from clarity, not exhaustion. Before escalating, it's worth asking: Have we said, directly and clearly, what the problem is? Have we given the relationship a genuine chance to work through it? Can we describe the concern specifically, without it becoming about the person? If the answer is yes, advocating firmly and through the right channels is not a failure of collaboration — it's part of taking the work seriously.

And one more thing worth saying directly: **be thoughtful about who you escalate to.** Not everyone we might want to talk to is actually in a position to help. Bringing a concern to someone who has no decision-making authority and no meaningful influence over the situation doesn't move anything forward. At best, we've added an unnecessary bystander to a private difficulty. At worst, we've created a trail of secondhand accounts that takes on a life of its own — shaping how people see us and the PI long after the original issue has passed.

Before looping someone in, ask honestly: *Can this person actually do something? Do they have the standing to influence the outcome?* If the answer is no, keep the circle small, find a mentor or supervisor with real standing to advise, and protect your own reputation by keeping difficult situations from becoming unnecessarily public.

> The colleagues who navigate this work most gracefully are not the ones who were never frustrated. They are the ones who stayed curious long enough to find out what was actually going on.


When the Budget Runs Out and We’re the One Who Has to Move
Few situations in research collaboration cut as deeply as this one. A PI reaches out and asks to meet. The tone is a little more formal than usual. And then they tell us: there isn’t enough funding left in the grant to keep us on at our current effort level. We need to move off, at least for now.
The first instinct is often to feel betrayed — I’ve been here from the beginning. I know this data. I helped shape this work. And underneath that, something harder: How did this happen? Didn’t they see this coming?
It’s worth being honest about the power dynamics at play here, because they are real. PIs hold structural authority over grant personnel in ways that aren’t always visible until a moment like this one. They control how budgets are built, how effort is allocated, and ultimately who stays on a project and who doesn’t. As key personnel, we contribute the expertise that makes the science credible — but we often have limited visibility into the financial decisions being made around us, and limited recourse when those decisions don’t go our way. That asymmetry can leave us feeling like we were never quite full partners, even when the work suggested otherwise.
The truth is, sometimes the budget wasn’t managed well. Grant finances are complicated, but they are also the PI’s responsibility. PIs vary enormously in how closely they track remaining funds, how proactively they communicate with their team about financial constraints, and how much they involve key personnel in planning before a problem becomes a crisis. Budget mismanagement is real and more common than the research world tends to acknowledge openly. And when it lands on us — when we’re the ones being moved off while the work continues — it’s reasonable to feel that the partnership wasn’t as mutual as it seemed.
And then there is a harder pattern worth naming, because it happens and we should be able to recognize it. Sometimes a PI who is facing a budget problem doesn’t lead with the budget. Instead, the conversation shifts — suddenly there are concerns about efficiency, about fit, about whether the work is moving fast enough. Criticism that never surfaced before appears now, framed in a way that makes the change feel performance-related rather than financial. The narrative becomes about replacing us with someone more efficient, cheaper, or better suited — when the underlying reality is simply that the money ran short and a justification was needed.
This is a disorienting thing to experience, because it asks us to doubt ourselves at exactly the moment when we most need clarity. If feedback feels sudden, inconsistent with everything that came before, or strangely timed relative to budget cycles or grant renewals, it’s worth pausing before internalizing it. That doesn’t mean becoming defensive or accusatory — but it does mean staying grounded in our own record of the work, the decisions that were made collaboratively, and the documentation we’ve kept along the way. A paper trail isn’t paranoia. It’s protection.
Sitting with these feelings is fair. But there’s a difference between acknowledging the imbalance and letting it drive every decision we make in the aftermath.
The PI delivering this news is often embarrassed, often scrambling, and often genuinely hoping the situation is temporary. That doesn’t erase the structural reality, but it does suggest that this moment — as uncomfortable as it is — may still be a conversation worth having rather than a door worth closing. Is there a path back onto the grant? Are there other projects where my effort could be supported? Can we document what’s been completed so the work isn’t lost? These are fair, professional questions, and how a PI responds to them tells us a great deal about what the relationship actually is.
This is also a moment to reflect on something longer term. If we find ourselves repeatedly in situations where budget decisions happen to us rather than with us, it may be worth asking whether our role on future projects reflects our actual contribution. There is a meaningful structural difference between being listed as key personnel and being named as a co-investigator. Key personnel can be moved, have their effort reduced, or be removed from a project with relatively little friction. A co-investigator has a formal stake in the project — named on the award, accountable to the funder, and much harder to quietly sideline when budgets get tight.
Pursuing co-investigator status isn’t about ego or title. It’s about alignment between the work we’re actually doing and the protections and visibility that should come with it. If we are shaping the statistical design, contributing to specific aims, and carrying analytical responsibility across the life of a project, that is co-investigator work. Naming it as such — in conversations with PIs when grants are being developed, not after they’ve been awarded — is one of the most concrete ways we can build real partnership rather than assume it.
The earlier we have that conversation, the better. A PI who genuinely values the collaboration will usually engage with it seriously. And a PI who resists it is giving us important information about how that partnership is likely to feel when things get hard.
What tends to be least productive in the immediate moment — even when completely understandable — is letting the frustration collapse into silence or withdrawal. The PI sitting across from us may still be the person best positioned to help us land somewhere stable. The goal isn’t to pretend the situation is acceptable. It’s to stay clear-headed enough to protect our own interests while keeping the conversation open.

Criticism that never surfaced before appears now, framed in a way that makes the change feel performance-related rather than financial. The narrative becomes about replacing us with someone more efficient, cheaper, or better suited — when the underlying reality is simply that the money ran short and a justification was needed.
One pattern that can help us see this more clearly: pay attention to when in the project arc the conversation happens. If a PI is suddenly eager for us to finish the most complex analytical work — the hard modeling, the messy data problems, the methodological heavy lifting that no one else on the team could easily pick up — before we transition off, that sequencing is telling. The complicated parts require us. The remaining work, by their own implicit logic, does not. That isn’t a performance story. That’s a budget story with a performance-shaped wrapper around it.
Recognizing this pattern isn’t about becoming cynical or assuming bad faith at every turn. It’s about staying grounded in what we actually observe. If the feedback is sudden, inconsistent with everything that came before, or strangely timed relative to budget cycles or grant renewals — and especially if we’re being asked to sprint through the hardest parts of the work on the way out — it’s worth pausing before internalizing it as a reflection of our value. That doesn’t mean becoming defensive or accusatory. But it does mean staying grounded in our own record of the work, the decisions that were made collaboratively, and the documentation we’ve kept along the way. A paper trail isn’t paranoia. It’s protection.
And when this PI comes back — because often they do, once a new grant is funded or a new project is spinning up — that history matters. It’s worth thinking carefully about what conditions would need to be different before re-engaging. Working again with someone who has demonstrated a willingness to obscure a budget problem as a performance problem is a real risk, and goodwill alone isn’t sufficient protection against it happening again.
The most concrete form of protection is structural. If a future collaboration is worth pursuing at all, pursuing it as a co-investigator rather than key personnel changes the terms in a meaningful way. As a co-I, we are named on the award, visible to the funder, and not easily moved without formal process. The conversation about effort and budget happens with us, not around us. That isn’t a guarantee against difficulty, but it is a fundamentally different kind of working relationship — one where our stake in the project is legible from the start.
If a PI is resistant to that conversation — if co-investigator status feels like too much to ask given the contribution we’d be making — that resistance is itself important information. A PI who wants our expertise but not our standing is telling us something about how they see the partnership. We get to decide whether that’s a collaboration worth entering, and on what terms.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

**A closing thought:** The difficult moments in this work are not detours from our development as biostatisticians — they are part of it. The judgment to know when to push and when to listen, when to advocate and when to understand, builds slowly through experience and reflection. Approach hard situations assuming good faith, pay attention to what you don't yet know, and remember that the person across the table is usually doing the best they can with what they have.
