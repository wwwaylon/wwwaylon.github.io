**Effective Date**: [Insert Date]  
**Version**: 1.0  
**Owner**: Biostatistics Department  
**Approval**: [Insert Approver Name/Title]

## Purpose  
To provide a standardized and FDA-compliant procedure for managing biostatistics support requests, ensuring quality, efficiency, and traceability throughout the workflow.  

---

## Scope  
This work instruction applies to all biostatistics support requests submitted to the Biostatistics Department. It covers the process from request submission to post-evaluation feedback.  

---

## Responsibilities  
- **Requester**: Provide complete and accurate information on the support request form.  
- **Biostatistics Coordinator**: Oversee the intake, triage, and assignment stages.  
- **Biostatistician**: Conduct consultation, analysis, and deliverables preparation.  
- **Biostatistics Supervisor**: Ensure adherence to timelines and quality standards.  

---

## Definitions  
- **Triage**: The process of reviewing and categorizing requests based on feasibility and priority.  
- **Deliverables**: Outputs provided to the requester, including statistical reports, datasets, or visualizations.  
- **Post-Evaluation**: Feedback collected from the requester to assess the process and outcomes.  

---

## Procedure  

### 1. Request Submission  
1. The requester submits a detailed support request form via the designated platform.  
2. **Required Fields**:  
   - Study objectives and hypotheses.  
   - Description of the data (e.g., “2024 survey data of 500 participants”) and statistical needs (e.g., “logistic regression analysis”).  
   - Deadlines and specific deliverables requested (e.g., “results by MM/DD/YYYY, graphs for presentation”).  
3. **Example**:  
   - A researcher submits a form requesting statistical analysis for a randomized controlled trial to test intervention efficacy.  

**Records Generated**: Request form (electronic), tracking ID.  

---

### 2. Triage and Review  
1. The Biostatistics Coordinator reviews the request within 2 business days.  
2. **Checklist for Review**:  
   - Completeness of the request (e.g., missing information about sample size).  
   - Feasibility based on provided data and requested analysis.  
3. **Example**:  
   - If the data description is vague, the coordinator requests clarification, such as asking for the variable names and formats.  

**Records Generated**: Triage checklist, clarification emails.  

---

### 3. Prioritization  
1. Requests are ranked based on urgency, complexity, and scope.  
2. **Criteria for Prioritization**:  
   - High priority: Deadline within 2 weeks.  
   - Medium priority: Deadline within 1 month.  
   - Low priority: Exploratory analyses with no specific deadline.  
3. **Example**:  
   - A grant application requiring statistical analysis for submission next week is given high priority.  

**Records Generated**: Prioritization matrix, request tracking log.  

---

### 4. Assignment  
1. The request is assigned to a biostatistician based on expertise and availability.  
2. Notify the requester of the assignment and provide the biostatistician’s contact information.  
3. **Example**:  
   - A request involving survival analysis is assigned to a biostatistician with expertise in survival methods.  

**Records Generated**: Assignment record, notification email.  

---

### 5. Consultation  
1. The biostatistician schedules an initial consultation with the requester.  
2. **Agenda for Consultation**:  
   - Clarify study goals (e.g., confirm variables to include in regression models).  
   - Discuss data cleaning needs (e.g., handle missing data).  
   - Agree on deliverables and timelines.  
3. **Example**:  
   - The biostatistician and requester decide to use logistic regression instead of linear regression after reviewing data distribution.  

**Records Generated**: Consultation report, meeting notes.  

---

### 6. Analysis and Execution  
1. The biostatistician performs the analysis according to the agreed plan.  
2. **Steps in Analysis**:  
   - Data cleaning (e.g., remove outliers or impute missing values).  
   - Statistical modeling (e.g., conduct a mixed-effects model).  
   - Generate graphs and tables.  
3. **Example**:  
   - The biostatistician creates survival curves and estimates hazard ratios for a study on patient outcomes.  

**Records Generated**: Analysis plan, statistical code, QC log.  

---

### 7. Results Delivery  
1. Deliver completed work in the requested format (e.g., PDF report, PowerPoint slides).  
2. Conduct a results walkthrough with the requester to address any questions.  
3. Obtain acknowledgment of receipt from the requester.  
4. **Example**:  
   - A final report includes a regression table, a diagnostic plot, and an executive summary of the results.  

**Records Generated**: Deliverables, acknowledgment form.  

---

### 8. Feedback and Post-Evaluation  
1. Requester completes a post-evaluation survey within 10 business days.  
2. Review feedback to identify areas for improvement.  
3. **Example**:  
   - A requester suggests simplifying the language in reports for non-statistical audiences.  
4. Implement corrective actions as needed.  

**Records Generated**: Feedback survey, corrective action report.  

---

## Quality Assurance and Auditing  
- Conduct quarterly audits of the biostatistics support process to ensure compliance with this work instruction.  
- Maintain all records for a minimum of 5 years for FDA review.  

**Records Reviewed**: Audit log, process documentation.
