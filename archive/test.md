# **Opinion: Balancing HR Pay Equity and Valuing Exceptional Talent in Research** 

Research organizations are often faced with a complex challenge: How do we retain and fairly compensate standout researchers while adhering to the pay equity guidelines set by Human Resources (HR)? 

This balance is critical, especially in research where the stakes are high, and the need for innovation, precision, and expertise is constant. 

HR departments often rely on structured pay scales that factor in years of experience as a primary measure of fairness. This approach, while understandable, can unintentionally undervalue top performers—particularly in highly specialized roles like biostatistics, where innovation and measurable impact are more relevant than the number of years in a job title. The challenge for leadership is to ensure that our most talented contributors feel recognized and rewarded, while also maintaining the principles of equity that HR rightly upholds. ## **The HR Perspective: Pay Equity Based on Experience** HR’s commitment to pay equity is designed to ensure fairness across the board. From their perspective, this approach: - **Ensures Consistency**: Employees with similar experience and roles are paid similarly, reducing internal tension and perceptions of favoritism. - **Complies with Legal Standards**: Regulations like the Equal Pay Act require HR to ensure employees in comparable roles receive equitable compensation. - **Controls Budgets**: Tenure-based pay scales provide predictability, allowing the organization to manage compensation costs effectively and plan long-term. In research institutions, HR must ensure that compensation is just and equitable across the diverse range of roles, from early-career analysts to senior researchers. Yet, the rigid application of tenure-based pay scales can fail to acknowledge the significant contributions of standout biostatisticians who produce high-value research, secure competitive grants, and drive scientific innovation. These professionals often find themselves capped by the institution’s compensation structure, particularly at the Principal level, where further pay growth stagnates despite continued high-level contributions. ## **The Biostatistician’s Perspective: When Experience Doesn’t Reflect Value** For many standout biostatisticians, years of experience may not align with their value to the organization. A professional who has pioneered new research methodologies, published extensively, or secured key grants may be bringing far more to the table than peers with the same (or more) years of experience but fewer tangible contributions. This disparity becomes more pronounced when we consider how years of experience are calculated. For example, a biostatistician who steps into a higher-level role (such as leading a department or managing large-scale projects) may return to a lower position later in their career. However, HR may not fully credit this higher-level experience when calculating their pay, treating them as if they had never moved beyond their original role. This failure to recognize higher-level contributions is frustrating for the individual and misses a key opportunity for the organization to leverage advanced skills. ## **The External Offer Dilemma: A Flawed Solution** In many cases, standout biostatisticians seeking better pay are advised—informally or otherwise—to obtain an external job offer as leverage for a higher salary. While this strategy can force the institution’s hand, it comes with several drawbacks: 1. **Erosion of Trust**: Relying on external offers to receive a deserved raise can create resentment. Employees feel undervalued, as though their contributions were not recognized until they threatened to leave. 2. **Unintended Departures**: The process of seeking external offers can lead to employees finding not only better compensation but also more opportunities for advancement, resulting in the loss of top talent. 3. **Instability**: Employees distracted by job searches reduce their focus on the current work, and the possibility of losing key contributors creates uncertainty within teams. 4. **Temporary Fix**: Even if HR adjusts pay in response to an external offer, it’s a short-term solution. The underlying issue of rigid pay structures remains unaddressed, potentially leading to a cycle of dissatisfaction. As a Director of Research, I’ve seen firsthand how this approach can be damaging—not just to employee morale but to the organization’s long-term goals. We risk losing our best and brightest when we don’t proactively recognize their contributions and provide a clear path for advancement. ## **The Limits of Tenure-Based Pay: The Biostatistics Principal Ceiling** One particular frustration for standout biostatisticians is the pay ceiling at the Principal level. Many biostatisticians with years of high-level contributions and innovative work find themselves maxing out at this rank, with limited opportunities for further salary increases. Even though their value to the organization continues to grow, the tenure-based system restricts their financial recognition. Moreover, the years of experience used to calculate tenure can be subjective. For instance, a biostatistician returning from a senior-level role may not receive full credit for their higher-level contributions, simply because their current title is lower. This lack of clarity in how experience is measured leads to a feeling of being penalized for previous success. ## **Best Practices for Retaining Top Biostatistics Talent** Balancing the demands of HR’s pay equity framework with the need to retain high-performing biostatisticians is not easy, but there are strategies we can adopt to strike this balance: 1. **Incorporate Performance-Based Pay Adjustments** HR and leadership should work together to introduce performance-based pay increases that go beyond tenure. For biostatisticians who contribute significantly through grant acquisition, research publications, or innovative methodologies, pay should reflect the value they bring to the organization—regardless of how many years they’ve held a specific title. 2. **Account for All Experience Levels** Experience gained in higher-level roles should count toward current compensation, even if the individual has returned to a lower-level position. Biostatisticians who have held senior positions but are now in more specialized roles still bring advanced skills and knowledge that should be reflected in their pay. 3. **Clear, Transparent Pay Policies** Transparency is critical. Employees should know how their pay is determined, and there should be clear pathways for achieving pay increases based on performance. If publishing in high-impact journals, leading significant projects, or securing major grants leads to a raise, this should be openly communicated. 4. **Expand Growth Opportunities Beyond the Principal Level** For top biostatisticians who max out at the Principal level, organizations should create higher tiers of compensation that reflect their continued contributions. This could include expert tracks or specialized roles that don’t require transitioning into management but still reward high-level performance. 5. **Non-Monetary Recognition** In addition to pay raises, organizations can provide non-monetary incentives to recognize top performers. Opportunities to lead high-profile projects, speak at conferences, or receive prestigious internal awards are ways to affirm value without relying solely on financial compensation. ## **A Call for Change: Moving Beyond Tenure-Based Compensation** As a research director, I understand the pressures HR faces to maintain equity and comply with regulations. But if we want to advance science, we need to move beyond rigid, tenure-based pay structures. In fields like biostatistics, innovation, and measurable contributions far outweigh years in a position. We need systems that reward our standout contributors, not just based on their time with the organization but on the true value they provide. By integrating performance-based metrics, recognizing the complexity of biostatisticians' roles, and creating clear paths for growth beyond the Principal level, we can retain the talent that pushes our work—and the field—forward. At the end of the day, we should be focusing on value, not just tenure, as the driving factor in compensation.
