#### <span style="color:lightsteelblue4; font-family:Palatino; font-size:1.25em;">PRODUCTIVITY AND QUALITY.</span>    
<span style="color:lightsteelblue4; font-family:Palatino;">My</span> <span style="color:firebrick; font-family:Palatino; font-size:1.25em;">**personal service mission**</span> <span style="color:lightsteelblue4; font-family:Palatino;"> is to provide *responsive*, *efficient*, and *high-quality* analytical support. To accomplish this, I regularly collect detailed information about research activities. Analysis of these data typically involve the calculation of indices that are helpful for assessment, for example:</span>   

<span style="color:lightsteelblue4; font-family:Palatino;">For Research Staff:</span>
  
1. <span style="color:lightsteelblue4; font-family:Palatino;">**Proportion of Staff Engaged in Grant Submissions**: This index measures the percentage of staff members actively involved in preparing and submitting research grant proposals. For example, if there are 10 staff members, and 7 of them have participated in grant submissions within a given time frame, the proportion would be 70%.</span>

1. <span style="color:lightsteelblue4; font-family:Palatino;">**Number of Projects per Staff Member**: This index quantifies the workload distribution among staff. It reflects the average number of research projects each staff member is currently handling. For instance, if there are 30 projects in total, and 10 staff members, the average would be 3 projects per staff member.</span>

1. <span style="color:lightsteelblue4; font-family:Palatino;">**Count of Grants, Publications, Presentations, Posters, and Other Forms of Dissemination**: This index tallies the actual numbers of grants received, research publications, presentations at conferences, posters, and other dissemination activities completed by each staff member within a specified period.</span>

1. <span style="color:lightsteelblue4; font-family:Palatino;">**Qualitative Feedback Rating**: Staff members can be assessed based on qualitative feedback received from stakeholders, collaborators, and peers. Feedback may include ratings, comments, or evaluations of their teamwork, communication, and problem-solving skills.</span>

1. <span style="color:lightsteelblue4; font-family:Palatino;">**Proportion of Billable Time per Staff Relative to Their Position**: This index measures the percentage of time each staff member spends on billable activities related to their role. For example, if a staff member is expected to spend 70% of their time on billable tasks and they actually spend 75% of their time, this index would be 107%.</span>

<span style="color:lightsteelblue4; font-family:Palatino;">For Research Leaders:</span>

1. <span style="color:lightsteelblue4; font-family:Palatino;">**Strategic Planning Success Rate**: Measures the percentage of strategic plans successfully executed under the leadership of research leaders. For example, if a research leader has successfully executed 80% of the strategic plans formulated during their tenure, their strategic planning success rate is 80%.</span>

1. <span style="color:lightsteelblue4; font-family:Palatino;">**Productivity Enhancement Index**: Quantifies the improvement in research productivity achieved under the guidance of the research leader compared to previous periods. It can be calculated by comparing metrics such as the number of publications, grants secured, or projects completed before and after the leader assumed their role.</span>

1. <span style="color:lightsteelblue4; font-family:Palatino;">**Funding Acquisition Success**: Reflects the ability of the research leader to secure research funding and grants for the team. It involves tracking the total amount of research funding obtained under their leadership. For instance, if a research leader secures $2 million in research grants during their tenure, this amount serves as a metric.</span>

1. <span style="color:lightsteelblue4; font-family:Palatino;">**Feedback from Team Members**: Incorporates feedback from team members on leadership effectiveness, team morale, and communication. It can include ratings, comments, or evaluations from team members on aspects such as communication, collaboration, and leadership style.</span>

1. <span style="color:lightsteelblue4; font-family:Palatino;">**Citation Metrics**: Tracks the number of citations of the research leader's publications, indicating the impact of their research on the academic community. They involve tracking the number of citations their publications receive. For example, if a research leader's publications collectively receive 1,000 citations, that serves as a metric of their research impact.</span>

1. <span style="color:lightsteelblue4; font-family:Palatino;">**Collaboration Network Growth**: Measures the expansion of the research leader's collaboration network, highlighting their influence in fostering partnerships. It reflects the increase in the number of collaborative partnerships they have established. For instance, if a research leader initially collaborates with five research groups and later collaborates with ten, this demonstrates growth in their collaboration network.</span>

1. <span style="color:lightsteelblue4; font-family:Palatino;">**Invited Talks and Keynotes**: Counts the number of invitations to deliver talks and keynotes at conferences, demonstrating recognition within the field.  It reflects recognition within the field and the demand for their expertise. For example, if a research leader is invited to deliver six talks in a year, this can serve as a metric of their impact.</span>

1. <span style="color:lightsteelblue4; font-family:Palatino;">**Research Output Increase**: This metric assesses the research leader's contribution to increasing research output within their team or department. It involves tracking metrics such as the number of publications, presentations, or patents generated by the team during their leadership tenure.</span>

1. <span style="color:lightsteelblue4; font-family:Palatino;">**Innovation Metrics**: These metrics measure the extent to which the research leader's leadership has led to innovative outcomes. For example, the number of new research methodologies, technologies, or products developed under their guidance can be counted.</span>

<span style="color:lightsteelblue4; font-family:Palatino;">These indices are calculated at the group-level to evaluate overall group progress and at the individual-level to allow for individual progress assessments in comparison with previous results and with the anonymous results of other staff members. Additionally, triangulating across multiple metrics, rather than relying on select metrics in isolation, is important for several reasons:</span>

* <span style="color:lightsteelblue4; font-family:Palatino;">**Comprehensive Evaluation**: Triangulation allows for a more comprehensive evaluation of a research leader's performance and impact. Using multiple metrics provides a holistic view of their contributions, capabilities, and effectiveness.</span>

* <span style="color:lightsteelblue4; font-family:Palatino;">**Balanced Assessment**: Different metrics capture different aspects of leadership and research impact. By triangulating, organizations can balance the assessment and avoid overemphasizing one aspect while neglecting others. This ensures a fair and balanced evaluation.</span>

* <span style="color:lightsteelblue4; font-family:Palatino;">**Reduction of Bias**: Relying on a single metric can introduce bias or limitations. Triangulation helps mitigate these biases. For example, a research leader might excel in securing research funding but may not have a high publication rate. By considering both metrics along with others, a more accurate picture emerges.</span>

* <span style="color:lightsteelblue4; font-family:Palatino;">**Contextual Understanding**: Triangulation helps provide context to the metrics. For instance, a high citation count may be impressive, but it's even more meaningful when combined with other metrics like collaboration growth or innovative outcomes. It helps answer questions like, "Why are the citations high, and how did the leader achieve this impact?"</span>

* <span style="color:lightsteelblue4; font-family:Palatino;">**Identification of Areas for Improvement**: Examining multiple metrics allows organizations to identify specific areas where a research leader may excel and areas where they may need improvement. This information is valuable for professional development and targeted support.</span>

* <span style="color:lightsteelblue4; font-family:Palatino;">**Risk Mitigation**: Relying on a single metric can be risky, as it might not capture all dimensions of leadership effectiveness and research impact. Triangulation helps reduce the risk of making critical decisions based on incomplete or biased information.</span>

* <span style="color:lightsteelblue4; font-family:Palatino;">**Robust Decision-Making**: Triangulation provides a more robust basis for decision-making. It allows organizations to make informed decisions about promotions, resource allocation, and leadership development with greater confidence.</span>

* <span style="color:lightsteelblue4; font-family:Palatino;">**Feedback Loop**: Triangulation encourages ongoing evaluation and feedback. Research leaders can receive a well-rounded assessment of their performance, which can inform their goals and strategies for improvement.</span>

* <span style="color:lightsteelblue4; font-family:Palatino;">**Transparent Assessment**: A triangulated approach to evaluation is often seen as more transparent and fair by stakeholders. It demonstrates that organizations are using a multifaceted approach to assess leadership and impact.</span>

* <span style="color:lightsteelblue4; font-family:Palatino;">**Strategic Alignment**: Triangulation helps ensure that a research leader's performance aligns with the organization's strategic goals and priorities. It allows organizations to assess whether the leader's contributions are driving the institution in the desired direction.</span>

<span style="color:lightsteelblue4; font-family:Palatino;">In summary, triangulating across multiple metrics offers a more comprehensive, balanced, and context-rich assessment of research leadership and impact. It reduces bias, supports informed decision-making, and contributes to continuous improvement and strategic alignment within organizations.</span>

<span style="color:lightsteelblue4; font-family:Palatino;">To illustrate this idea, Figure 1 shows the development of scholarly activity based on select group-level indicies across three years of leadership. As shown in Figure 1, the team supported</span> <span style="color:firebrick; font-family:Palatino; font-size:1.25em;">**65**</span> <span style="color:lightsteelblue4; font-family:Palatino;">grant submissions during the final year (Oct. 2016 to Nov. 2017), an increase from</span> <span style="color:firebrick; font-family:Palatino; font-size:1.25em;">**46**</span> <span style="color:lightsteelblue4; font-family:Palatino;">the previous year and</span> <span style="color:firebrick; font-family:Palatino; font-size:1.25em;">**10**</span> <span style="color:lightsteelblue4; font-family:Palatino;"> from my first year with the team (July to October 2015). Pre-award grant work required close resource management to ensure fiscal sustainability.</span> <img align="left" width="500" height="265" src="/assets/img/BEEPacademics.png" alt="results plot"> <span style="color:lightsteelblue4; font-family:Palatino;">This substantial growth was accomplished in part by increases in efficiency due to experience and focused training, a developing library of grant templates and power analysis code, and increasing demand for this service. Also, we increased the percent of staff involved in grant submisions from</span> <span style="color:firebrick; font-family:Palatino; font-size:1.25em;">**20%**</span> <span style="color:lightsteelblue4; font-family:Palatino;">in 2014-2015 to</span> <span style="color:firebrick; font-family:Palatino; font-size:1.25em;">**80%**</span> <span style="color:lightsteelblue4; font-family:Palatino;">in 2016-2017 with </span> <span style="color:firebrick; font-family:Palatino;">**60%**</span> <span style="color:lightsteelblue4; font-family:Palatino;"> of staff included as co-investigators on at least one grant proposal during the last year.</span> 

* <span style="color:lightsteelblue4; font-family:Palatino; font-size:1.20em;">Qualitative grant reviews described our grant methodology and analysis sections as:</span> <span style="color:firebrick; font-family:Palatino; font-size:1.20em;">**innovative**, **clear**, **well-reasoned and appropriate**, **well thought out**,</span> <span style="color:lightsteelblue4; font-family:Palatino; font-size:1.20em;">and </span> <span style="color:firebrick; font-family:Palatino; font-size:1.20em;">**clearly indicated in the proposal in a highly detailed and concise manner**. </span> <span style="color:lightsteelblue4; font-family:Palatino; font-size:1.20em;">Similarly the principal investigators summerized our work as:</span> <span style="color:firebrick; font-family:Palatino; font-size:1.20em;">**excellent**, **thoughtful**, **state-of-the-art**,</span> <span style="color:lightsteelblue4; font-family:Palatino; font-size:1.20em;">and </span> <span style="color:firebrick; font-family:Palatino; font-size:1.20em;">**perhaps the most thorough part of the grant**.</span>

<span style="color:lightsteelblue4; font-family:Palatino;">Published manuscripts also increased with staff co-authorship from </span> <span style="color:firebrick; font-family:Palatino; font-size:1.25em;">**5**</span> <span style="color:lightsteelblue4; font-family:Palatino;"> in 2014-2015 to </span> <span style="color:firebrick; font-family:Palatino; font-size:1.25em;">**31**</span> <span style="color:lightsteelblue4; font-family:Palatino;"> publications in 2016-2017 (see Figure 1). Many of these publications were in top tier journals (some with an impact factor > 5). During the last year, team-authored publications were cited a total of </span> <span style="color:firebrick; font-family:Palatino; font-size:1.25em;">**783**</span> <span style="color:lightsteelblue4; font-family:Palatino;"> times, with a median of </span> <span style="color:firebrick; font-family:Palatino; font-size:1.25em;">**16**</span> <span style="color:lightsteelblue4; font-family:Palatino;"> citations per staff member.</span> 
   
<span style="color:lightsteelblue4; font-family:Palatino;">Overall, Figure 1 illustrates </span><span style="color:firebrick; font-family:Palatino; font-size:1.25em;">**the coalescence of a new vision for team leadership within the organization**</span> <span style="color:lightsteelblue4; font-family:Palatino;"> that resulted in new funding, partnerships, and additional value offered by the team.</span> 
  
### <span style="color:lightsteelblue4; font-family:Palatino; font-size:1.25em;">TECHNICAL SKILLS.</span>   
  
<span style="color:firebrick; font-family:Palatino; font-size:1.25em;">**Statistics and quantitative methods.** </span> <span style="color:lightsteelblue4; font-family:Palatino;">My primary research focus revolves around the creation of innovative statistical methods designed to bridge the gap between the tangible benefits observed in controlled experimental simulations and the more complex and often challenging real-world applications. In these practical scenarios, we encounter a myriad of limitations that demand creative solutions.</span> 

<span style="color:lightsteelblue4; font-family:Palatino;">One of my central areas of expertise and interest lies in addressing the issue of missing data. I have taken a lead role in conducting simulation-based research to tackle this problem effectively and have made significant contributions to shaping best practices for applied researchers in this domain. Notably, in 2012, my work in advancing multivariate approaches for the measurement and analysis of substantive problems earned me a research grant from the Society for Multivariate Experimental Psychology. This grant emphasized the significance of this research in enhancing our understanding and application of statistical methodologies in real-world contexts, especially when confronted with intricate challenges such as missing data.</span>

<span style="color:firebrick; font-family:Palatino; font-size:1.25em;">**Over simplified data analytic practices within the social, behavioral, and health sciences.** </span> <span style="color:lightsteelblue4; font-family:Palatino;">Within the realms of social, behavioral, and health sciences, there is a common issue of oversimplified data analysis practices that restrict our research vision. We often find ourselves trapped by our approach to data, where we invest substantial intellectual effort in developing intricate theories about how the world functions. These theories represent deep thinking on a subject. However, these well-thought-out theories are frequently fragmented into smaller pieces and forced into standardized statistical procedures that were never intended to address the original research questions adequately.</span>

<span style="color:lightsteelblue4; font-family:Palatino;">My dedication lies in recognizing these limiting practices, illustrating their shortcomings with contemporary examples, and presenting viable alternatives to discourage their continued usage. In many cases, we aspire not only to understand if predictive relationships exist but also to delve into how they function and under what conditions they are strong or weak. Moreover, we seek greater flexibility when examining changes over time.</span>

<span style="color:lightsteelblue4; font-family:Palatino;">To this end, I have actively collaborated with fellow researchers, successfully securing </span> <span style="color:firebrick; font-family:Palatino; font-size:1.25em;">**more than $5 million**</span> <span style="color:lightsteelblue4; font-family:Palatino;">in new research funding. This collaborative effort has equipped me with extensive experience in applying a diverse array of best-practice methodologies to address complex challenges in emerging areas of research.</span>
