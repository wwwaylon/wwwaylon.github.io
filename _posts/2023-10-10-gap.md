# Understanding Simple Mediation in R

In statistical analysis, mediation refers to the process through which one variable mediates or explains the relationship between two other variables. This concept is crucial in various fields, including psychology, social sciences, and epidemiology, where researchers often need to understand the mechanisms underlying observed relationships.

In this blog post, we'll explore a piece of R code that performs a simple mediation analysis and generates power curves to assess the statistical power of the mediation model under different conditions.

## Setting up the Environment

```r
# Initialize variables and parameters
w = NULL  # We'll store results in this variable
mcmcReps <- 10000
seed <- 461981
powReps <- 2000
conf <- 95  # Confidence Level (%)
n_list = c(seq(50, 300, by = 10))  # Sample size
a_list = c(0.14, 0.20, 0.26, 0.30, 0.39)  # Values of 'a'
c_list = c(.39)  # Values of 'cprime'
SDX <- 1
SDM <- 1
SDY <- 1
```
