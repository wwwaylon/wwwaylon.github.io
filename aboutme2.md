I'm passionate about bridging the gap between research and reality, transforming intricate questions into clear, impactful insights that inform decision-making and foster positive change. Leading the research design and analytics efforts at a non-profit institute, I help develop and execute rigorous studies, harnessing data to address pressing social and health issues, and examining the intricate relationships between media, technology, and human behavior, to inform data-driven strategies and promote meaningful impact.

  <strong>One project that exemplifies my work</strong> is the development of a novel statistical approach to assess early language performance in children. By collaborating with a multidisciplinary team, we aimed to translate complex theoretical models of language development into actionable insights.

- The challenge was to bridge the gap between traditional data analysis methods and the nuanced research questions. Through the application of advanced statistical techniques, such as parallel process piecewise latent growth curve modeling, we uncovered intricate patterns in language development, revealing how children transition from one communication strategy to another. This approach allowed us to evaluate the theory of change and identify inter-individual differences in intra-individual change, providing a more accurate and flexible understanding of language development. This project highlights the essence of my work: harnessing the power of data to reveal insights that matter, and challenging traditional approaches to unlock new perspectives on complex research questions.

- As someone passionate about research, I believe that turning complex research questions and data into clear insights is crucial in today's fast-changing landscape. It's not just about advancing knowledge; it's about making a tangible difference. Ultimately, we want to know who benefits, under what conditions, and why - so we can create meaningful change. My expertise lies in applying advanced statistical techniques to deliver transformative results. 

- This includes modeling individual, group, and developmental differences; utilizing sophisticated structural equation modeling methods (e.g., latent growth curve modeling, multiple group SEM, multilevel SEM, latent profile analysis); conducting rigorous construct validation and measurement assessments (e.g., validity, reliability, measurement invariance); addressing conditional process effects (e.g., moderation, mediation); and implementing robust missing data estimation strategies, to unravel complex data structures and identify meaningful patterns. By implementing these methods, I ensure that our findings are robust, replicable, and directly applicable to real-world contexts. 

- Whether optimizing study designs to minimize bias or employing rigorous methods to address data collection and quality limitations, I prioritize statistical precision to deliver reliable, evidence-based results. This approach not only strengthens the validity of our research but also ensures that the insights we generate deliver concrete, data-driven decisions with lasting impact.
